Boris Bikes
======================

Week 1 at Makers Academy - Paired with [Thomas](https://github.com/TStrothjohann).

The goal of this project is to introduce you to:

- Behaviour Driven Development (BDD);
- How BDD relates to Test Driven Development (TDD), and
- The process of domain modeling for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (which is strongly related to DDD - Domain Driven Design).

Object Oriented model of the Boris Bikes London bicycle system wthout the tutorial.

I wrote this code using TDD best practices with RSpec. The goal of this project was to introduce RSpec and Object Oriented design as well as how objects can communicate to each other.

Technologies used
